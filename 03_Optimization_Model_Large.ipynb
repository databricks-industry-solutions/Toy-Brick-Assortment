    "## Base LEGO Assortment Model Class\n",
    "\n",
    "We will define a class object of the base LEGO assortment model. For a step-by-step review of the mathematical programming concepts and a detailed description of the base model please refer to the notebook <a href=\"$./Optimization_Model\">Optimization_Model</a>. The description for each of the elements of the optimization is also given in the doc string for each component defined within the `BaseLegoModel` class. Using this type of definition for our base model is beneficial because it promotes code reusability and modularity. By defining a base model class, we can extend its functionality in derived classes through class inheritance without duplicating code. This approach ensures that any updates or changes to the base model are automatically inherited by all derived classes, making the code easier to maintain and extend. Additionally, it allows us to implement new features, such as the parts purchase logic (implemented towards the end of this notebook), in a structured and consistent manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class defines all the components required to formulate and solve the assortment optimization problem:\n",
    "- The sets and parameters that describe the available inventory as generated by the data preparation notebook that runs in the first code cell of this notebook\n",
    "- An instance of a gurobi environment class `Env` parameterized by license arguments in `GUROBI_LIC` which will house the models to be solved by Gurobi\n",
    "- An instance of a gurobi model class `Model` parameterized initially with the solver parameters in `GUROBI_OPTIONS` which will be attached to the environment and modified with the mathematical program components:\n",
    "    - `_binary_variables` defines the set of binary variables (0 or 1) indexed over LEGO sets that indicate whether or not a LEGO set is built in the optimized collection\n",
    "    - `_constraint_part_inventory`defines the set of constraints that assure that the inventory quantity for each part in a particular color is respected. Namely, we cannot use more parts than available to build LEGO sets. Ultimately these constraints force us to choose the most valuable sets overall subject to inventory availability\n",
    "    - `_objective_function` defines an objective function expression that specifies the total value of the collection by summing the individual contributions from the optimally selected sets. In other words, no value is contributed to the objective function from a set that is not selected to be built. In this case we want to obtain the highest value possible which corresponds to a maximization of this objective function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- `define_model` builds the model object with all the required components\n",
    "- `solve_model` solves the model object in the specified gurobipy environment\n",
    "- `write_solution` writes the set selection variables and unused inventory parts to dataframes\n",
    "- `free_environment`  first disposes the model attached to the environment, and subsequently disposes the environment freeing up the license to be used for other applications"

    "Let’s explore an alternative solution that skips the optimization solver to get a \"good enough\" solution. We implement a greedy search algorithm where we attempt to build LEGO sets with the highest value as much as possible. First, we sort LEGO sets in descending order of value. Then, we attempt to build the most valuable set first. If successful, the parts are removed from the available inventory, and the algorithm moves to the next valuable set in the queue to determine if it can be built or not. This process continues until all sets have been considered or all available inventory is used up."

    "The part purchase option recovers value optimally according to the part purchase budget. Gurobi has selected the precise set that maximizes the overall collection value at each specified point, with a global optimality guarantee, while respecting the allowed budget for parts purchase. As shown by the figures above, one can adjust the maximum number of parts to be purchased to a high enough value to recover all the initial sets (e.g. `p_max_parts_purchased = 2500`). However, we can't recover the original value as the modified objective takes into account the incurred cost of parts purchase. The Number of unused pieces decreases at a rate the almost mirrors the increase of value as more parts are allowed. Finally, note that the extended model formulation is equivalent to the original base model formulation if the part budgets is set to zero. \n",
